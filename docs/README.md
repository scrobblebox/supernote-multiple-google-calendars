# Supernote Sync Multiple Google Calendars into One

When you connect your Google Calendar to your Supernote, only the default calendar appears. This script allows you to copy events from other calendars into your primary calendar.  

This is a modification in name only of https://github.com/karbassi/sync-multiple-google-calendars 

## Getting Starting

1. Create or login to your "primary account" - the account you'll login to with your Supernote.
2. Share all calendars you want to merge with this account
3. Log into the Google Apps Scripts website": https://script.google.com/home
4. Click on "New Project".
5. Replace everything in `Code.gs` with the contents of [SyncCalendarsIntoOne.gs].
6. Create a new script file called `BatchRequests.gs` with the contents of [BatchRequests.gs]
7. Update `calendarsToMerge`, `calendarToMergeInto`, `SYNC_DAYS_IN_PAST`, and `SYNC_DAYS_IN_FUTURE` variables. Be sure to save.
8. Click the `Project Settings` Gear icon on the left panel. Check the `Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor`.
9. Go back to code editor on the left, and update its content with [appsscript.json].
10. Click `Run`. This will load the `Authorization required` window since it's your first time running the script.
11. Click on `Review permissions` and give it permission to your account.
12. Click on `Triggers` clock icon on the left panel to add a trigger. Click on `Add Trigger`.
   - You have two choices, "Time-driven" or "From calendar".
   - Time-driven will run every X minutes/hours/etc. Use this if you have calendars that update frequently (more than 5-10 times in a 15 minute timespan)
   - "From calendar" will run when a given calendar updates. Use this if you want instant merging.

     a. **Time-driven**

     - "Choose which function to run": `SyncCalendarsIntoOne`
     - "Choose which deployment should run": `Head`
     - "Select event source": `Time-driven`
     - "Select type of time based trigger": choose what works for you.
     - Click "Save"

     b. **From calendar**

     - "Choose which function to run": `SyncCalendarsIntoOne`
     - "Choose which deployment should run": `Head`
     - "Select event source": `From calendar`
     - "Enter calendar details": enter one of the calendars you are merging _from_.
     - Click "Save"
     - Repeat these steps for every calendar you're merging _from_.

11. Enjoy!

## Notes

- Google App Scripts has a daily quote of 5k events created per day. See [Quotas for Google Services]
